# PHP "Hello, world!" Web App

A simple web app for demonstration / testing implementation in a container based environment such as [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) or [rkt](https://coreos.com/rkt/).

## Running with Docker Compose

### Prerequisites

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/).
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
- Host ports: 80, 443, 9022.
- SSH with a default private/public key pair.

### Recommended

- Chrome [Xdebug Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc).

### Configure

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and change values to suite.

**Note:** It is recommended to set your own username and default SSH public key.

### Bring Up the Services

Build the `httpd` service and run all required services in the background.

```
$ docker-compose up -d
```

The app will be available on the docker host. i.e http://localhost/ if running Docker on the local host.

### Rebuilding the Services

After making a change the httpd service's image needs to be rebuilt.

**Note:** If rebuilding the image is undesirable, another option is to mount the local path's into the container by uncommenting the applicable volumes in the [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml) file.

```
$ docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Bring Down the Services

Tear down the services when not in use.

```
$ docker-compose down
```

## Alternative Services

The default Apache PHP environment for the httpd service is Apache 2.2 / PHP 5.3 (Prefork) - to run the services with alternative images you need to specify both the base and override docker-compose configuration files.

### Bringing Up the Apache 2.2 / PHP 5.3 (FastCGI) Services

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-v1.yml up -d
```

### Bringing Up the Apache 2.4 / PHP 5.6 (PHP-FPM) Services

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-v2.yml up -d
```

### Bringing Up the Apache 2.4 / PHP 7.2 (PHP-FPM) Services

```
$ docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose-v3.yml up -d
```

## Xdebug debugging

### IDE Key

Set the appropriate xdebug.idekey configuration value using the `DBGP_IDEKEY` environment variable in the `.env` file. For the PHPStorm IDE the value should be `PHPSTORM`, for Atom the value should be `xdebug-atom`. If using the recommended [Xdebug Helper](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/xdebug-helper/eadndfjplgieldjbigjakmdgkmoaaaoc) Chrome extension, set the same IDE Key value in the extensions options.

### Port Forwarding

Xdebug is configured with `xdebug.remote_host = localhost` so SSH can be used to forward the docker host's local port 9000 to port 9000 on the host running the IDE.

The following command connects to the httpd container on port 9022 and forwards the remote port 9000 to localhost on local port 9000 - the `-f` and `-N` options are used to run it in the background and forward ports only. If your IDE is configured to listen on a port other than 9000 you would need to modify the last, (hostport), value.

```
$ ssh -p 9022 -fNR 9000:localhost:9000 localhost
```
